Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to have this space where I can share thoughts, reflections, and insights beyond what fits into a Sunday sermon or a book chapter.

## What to Expect

Here you'll find posts about:

- **Scripture** — Diving deeper into passages and themes from God's Word
- **Christian History** — Stories and lessons from the saints who came before us
- **Ministry** — Reflections on pastoral life and serving the local church
- **Faith & Life** — How the gospel shapes the way we live every day

## Why a Blog?

There are so many conversations that begin on Sunday morning but deserve more space to develop. A blog gives me the chance to explore ideas at a pace that allows for depth, and it gives you the chance to revisit and reflect on your own time.

I hope this becomes a place of encouragement and growth for you. If something resonates, I'd love to hear from you — feel free to [reach out](/contact).

Grace and peace,
Justin
